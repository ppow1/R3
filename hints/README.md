# R3 Hints Library

This directory is the first-level reference index for the root [AI_HINTS.md](../AI_HINTS.md).

## Convention

- Keep the root `AI_HINTS.md` short: orientation, critical guardrails, and links.
- When asked to “add something to AI_HINTS,” put substantive guidance in a focused document under `hints/`, then add or update a concise root pointer.
- Link to authoritative documents elsewhere instead of copying their contents. Avoid multiple competing sources of truth.
- Name files for stable subjects; revise existing topic files instead of creating dated duplicates unless historical versioning is required.
- Keep verified implementation state separate from requirements and plans.

## Starting references

- [Engineering and continuation](engineering.md): workflow, branch/worktree discipline, and current handoff.
- [Institutional architecture](architecture.md): charter and capability-first, durable institution principles.
- [Deployment](deployment.md): Comms-first execution, Camrui bootstrap and verification.
- [Resident avatar system](resident-avatar-system.md): shared browser runtime, animation API, asset provenance, and pending authorized backend bridge.

## Grace integration guidance — preserved source

The following guidance is preserved from the approved Grace integration revision. Where instructions conflict, the Steward's R3 independence and unified-release directive takes precedence.

- [Institutional architecture](architecture.md): charter and capability-first, durable institution principles.
- [Deployment](deployment.md): Comms-first execution, Camrui bootstrap and verification.
- **[R3 runtime routing and authentication discovery](r3-runtime-routing.md)**: known host, ports, legacy-vs-current release paths, diagnostic evidence and required checks.
- [Q2 script queue](q2-script-queue.md): Windows watched-folder submission and execution-result retrieval.
- [ChatGPT image publishing](chatgpt-image-publishing.md): Steward download, Q2 copy to A:, GitHub upload, and checksum verification.
