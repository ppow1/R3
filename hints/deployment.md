# Deployment and operations

- **[Live runtime topology and authentication discovery](r3-runtime-routing.md)** — mandatory preflight; do not confuse legacy 8303/main deployment with newer immutable R3 releases.
- [Current implementation handoff](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md) — Camrui target, manual bootstrap and pending work.
- [R3 capability API](../r3_app.py) — current source; verify deployed behavior separately.
- [Q2 Windows script queue](q2-script-queue.md) — write PowerShell scripts into Q2, let the watcher dispatch them, and read Queue/Results.

Try Riverview Comms 1.1 before asking the Steward to run commands. Do not claim deployment or runtime behavior without observed evidence. Keep credentials out of browser-facing code.
